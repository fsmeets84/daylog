### Production Installation (Docker Compose)

1. **Download docker-compose.yml file:**

```bash
wget https://github.com/artifacts-oss/daylog/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
```

2. **Setup .env file:**

Download the .env.example file and rename it to .env.

```bash
wget https://github.com/artifacts-oss/daylog/releases/latest/download/default.env.example -O .env
```

You can keep the default values or you can change them.

3. **Run docker compose:**

docker compose up -d --build
```

### Production Installation (npm)

To install and run daylog in a production environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artifacts-oss/daylog.git
cd daylog
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy `.env.example` and setup your own variables. **Important:** by default daylog uses PostgreSQL, you can change your conection string to any other database engine supported by Prisma ORM. You can follow their [guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/connection-urls) to achieve this step.

4. **Initialize the Prisma database:**

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

6. **Build the application:**

```bash
npm run build
```

7. **Start the application:**

```bash
npm start
```

8. **(optional) Configure a process manager:**
   Use a process manager like PM2 to keep your application running:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "daylog" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

9. **Set up a reverse proxy:**
   Configure a reverse proxy using Nginx or another web server to forward requests to your Node.js application.

10. **Secure your application:**
    Ensure your application is served over HTTPS and configure appropriate security headers.

Your daylog application should now be running in a production environment.

### Initial Setup

Go to `http://localhost:3000/register/init` to create an admin user.

After creating the admin user, you can log in using the credentials you just created.

Check the `.env` file to see the available environment variables.
